Our Story
Formerly known as We Decor8 (2018–2025), Evergreenry was founded by Ruchika
Wadhwa Bhalla, who left behind corporate life to follow her passion for plants and design.
What began with styling balconies soon grew into full-scale green decor projects for offices,
commercial spaces, and hospitality clients across India.
Today, Evergreenry creates calming, stylish environments through indoor plants, green
walls, and sustainable green decor solutions. From live installations to low-maintenance and
faux options, we bring nature in to everyday spaces, making them more vibrant, peaceful,
and inspiring.

Our Mission
At Evergreenry, we envision a world where every workspace, lobby, breakout zone, and
boardroom is enriched with nature — starting with something as simple as one plant on
every desk.
We believe plants are more than just aesthetic additions. They’re living elements that foster
calm, boost creativity, and promote overall well-being. In today’s fast-paced corporate
environments, a plant offers a small yet powerful pause — a moment to breathe, refocus,
and reconnect with the natural world.
Our mission is rooted in the idea of plant companionship. When employees care for a plant
— even something as small as watering or adjusting its position — they engage in a quiet act
of mindfulness. Over time, this relationship cultivates a more positive, present, and stress-
resilient mindset.
Because when you take care of a plant, it quietly takes care of you.
